REXXIPC V1.30-001
-----------------


DESCRIPTION

The RexxIPC library provides access to OS/2 Inter
Process Communication capabilities for Rexx programs.
Threads, named pipes, semaphores (event, mutex and
muxwait) and queues are supported.


DISTRIBUTION

The copyright owner allows the free distribution
of the following files, as long as they are kept
together, unmodified:

    REXXIPC.DLL -- The library.
    REXXIPC.INF -- The documentation.
    REXXIPC.TXT -- This text.
    TESTIPC.CMD -- A test program.
    TESTIPC.CFG -- A test configuration.
    FILE_ID.DIZ -- Identification.


INSTALLATION

The file REXXIPC.DLL should be put in a directory
listed in the LIBPATH statement (CONFIG.SYS).

For easy access, the file REXXIPC.INF may be put in
a directory listed in the BOOKSHELF statement (also
in CONFIG.SYS).

The following Rexx commands should be executed, either
at system startup, or at the beginning of the Rexx files
using RexxIPC:

    call RxFuncAdd 'IPCLoadFuncs', 'REXXIPC', 'IPCLoadFuncs'
    call IPCLoadFuncs

Please note that the third parameter of the call to
RxFuncAdd ('IPCLoadFuncs') is case sensitive.

When executing the TestIPC program, the file TESTIPC.CFG
must be in the same directory as TESTIPC.CMD.


PROBLEMS

Since this library is used in a production environment,
the author is interested in problem reports.

Although this is not a guarantee, informations on serious
difficulties may lead to a post of a corrected library.

NOTE

The documentation assumes that the user has other sources
of information on the OS/2 Control Program API.
